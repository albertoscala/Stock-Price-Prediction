# Stock Price Prediction
This repository, was created with a straightforward objective: to comprehend the mechanics of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models and their practical implementation. Specifically, the focus here is on predicting the adjusted close prices of NVIDIA stocks.

## Installation

To explore and understand the workings of this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Review the provided documentation to understand the implementation steps.
3. Create a python virtual enviroment inside the cloned repository using the `python -m venv .` command.
4. Install the requirements using the `bin/pip install -r requirements.txt` command.
5. Dive into the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to see the LSTM model in action, particularly in predicting NVIDIA stock prices.

## Implementation

In this section, I will provide a detailed walkthrough of the implementation steps involved in utilizing the LSTM model to predict the adjusted close price of NVDA stocks.

### Understanding the dataset

Embarking on the journey of machine learning necessitates a foundational understanding of the dataset. Within this context, our dataset comprises seven distinct columns, each offering crucial insights:

- **Date**: A straightforward timestamp denoting each data point.
- **Open**: Reflecting the opening price of the stock for a given day.
- **High**: Signifying the peak price reached by the stock on that particular day.
- **Low**: Denoting the lowest recorded price of the stock during the day.
- **Close**: Indicating the closing price of the stock at the end of the trading day.
- **Adjusted Close**: Representing the closing price adjusted for dividends.
- **Volume**: Offering a measure of the total trading activity for the day.
